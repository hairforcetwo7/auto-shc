# auto-shc
(Work in Progress, Renovation underway) This is supposed to be a test program, which uses Artificial Intelligence for automation and symptom matching, but has pre-generated responses to the user's selected prompt.
-Its model will ask the user a question, and display a few set of prompts through which they can pick and get a pre-generated piece of advice for by the program.
-It will also include the option to find centres for help and Discord servers through which they can seek professional help.
